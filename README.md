# CellularAutomata
This is my attempt at doing something with functional programming.
(Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk)

Simulate 1D and 2D cellular automata with Javascript.

automata.html simulates 1 dimensional cellular. The top row is the randomly generated starting generation. 
Each successive row is computed based on the previous row using a randomly defined pattern (shown at the top).

automata2.html fills a 2d grid with cells, and changes over time based on surrounding cells. Currently, it simulates
Conway's game of life.
